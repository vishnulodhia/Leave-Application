## Leave-Application System

This repository hosts the code for a comprehensive Leave-Application system, utilizing modern technologies to enhance organizational leave management processes with a multi-tiered user interface and robust backend.

### Key Features:

#### User Roles:
The system supports three distinct user roles:
- **Admins:** Manage user accounts including creation, updates, and activation statuses.
- **Managers:** Organized into three levels to form an approval hierarchy for leave requests. The process is designed to halt if any manager at any level rejects an application.
- **Employees:** Capable of submitting leave requests that are processed through the established managerial hierarchy.

### Technologies Used:

- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Angular

This system is ideal for organizations seeking to streamline their leave management procedures with a clear, hierarchical approval process and a robust, scalable web application.
